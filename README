A C reimplementation of the tricky bits of Python's Popen.

It is currently implemented in a very specific way and might break under
general use.

NOTE: This object can be replaced by subprocess32 in python2.7. subprocess32
package covers all required fix that already part of python3 and we have in
cpopen. cpopen adds more options such as deathSignal, but those are not
standard in popen interface anyway.

# TODO

* Support string invocation - Currently only support array invocation
* Support after fork func
* Support all stream modes - Currently everything has to be PIPE

# Usage

```{.python}
import cpopen
proc = cpopen.CPopen(["echo", "3"])
proc.communicate()
```

# Running the tests

```{.bash}
nosetests tests/tests.py
```
